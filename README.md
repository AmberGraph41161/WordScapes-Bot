# WordScapes-Bot
This is my third project to the wordscapes bot project. Nothing much more to say here...

I would like to reiterate that I'm no professional coder, and if my code looks bad or terrible to look at
I am super sorry about that, and I would love to get constructive critisism.

The whole licensing I still do not understand/am too lazy to read about but to my general knowledge, the GNU general public use license or whatever
lets whoever and whatever to do whatever/copy/use/remake/edit my code. I dunno if I got the licensing wrong or not, but I do not care what happens to
my code. You can edit, delete, share, mutate, eat, poop, pee, anything goes (not that I expect anybody to touch this anytime soon anyways lol)

note:
this was made on 3/1/2022 12:56AM all in one go/day. didn't take too long. very simple code imo
